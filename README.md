# turntable-as-stream

List of commands I executed on my raspberry pi to stream my turntable locally. I hope there are not too many mistakes ;)

All files which get touched with nano can be found in this repo.

## Required hardware

As I am new to turntables I have no idea if I spent too much money on single components. The sound is awsome for me so I'm happy with it.

* Turntable (e.g. Sony PS-T33)
* Preamplifier if not built in in your turntable (e.g. Pro-Ject Phono Box)
* AUX to RCA cable
* USB Sound card (e.g. Delock USB Sound Adapter 7.1 )
* Raspberry Pi (I use raspbian stretch lite as operating system)
* Radio streaming app where you can add custom urls (e.g. TuneIn)
